OBSOLETE!  MUPDF HAS SUBSEQUENTLY IMPLEMENTED THIS EXACT FUNCTIONALITY:

https://mupdf.com/docs/manual-mupdf-gl.html

STACKSMITH-MODIFICATIONS:
  Modified version of MuPDF attemps to store a .bmk file alongside the
original file.  The .bmk file contains 10 ints, each with a page number
corresponding to a bookmark.  Bookmarks are set with <1-9>m and recalled
with<1-9>t; setting a mark will attempt to rewrite the bookmark file.
Read-only directories or lack of write access should be tolerated.

Modifications are in platform/x11/pdfapp.c in
  pdfapp.h - added file handle to the app structure
  pdfapp_open( - attempt to read bookmark file; if missing write an empty one
  pdfapp_onkey( - in case of 'm', attempt to write bookmark file

ABOUT

MuPDF is a lightweight PDF, XPS, EPUB and CBZ viewer and parser/rendering
library.

The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased graphics. It
renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within fractions of a pixel
for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of a printed page on screen.

MuPDF is also small, fast, and yet complete. We support PDF 1.7 with
transparency, encryption, hyperlinks, annotations, search and many other bells
and whistles. MuPDF can also read XPS documents (OpenXPS / ECMA-388),
EPUB and CBZ (Comic Book archive) files.

MuPDF is written to be both modular and portable; the example applications
are merely thin layers on top of the functionality offered by the library,
so custom viewers can be easily built for a wide range of platforms. Example
viewer applications are supplied for Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS and Android.

MuPDF is deliberately designed to be threading library agnostic, while still
supporting multi-threaded operation. In the absence of a thread library
it will run single-threaded, but by adding one significant benefits in
rendering speed on multi-core platforms can be obtained.

Interactive features such as form filling, javascript and transitions
are in development and partially supported by the Android application.

COMPILING

If you are compiling from source you will need several third party libraries:
freetype2, jbig2dec, libjpeg, openjpeg, and zlib. These libraries are contained
in the source archive. If you are using git, they are included as git
submodules.

You will also need the X11 headers and libraries if you're building on Linux.
These can typically be found in the xorg-dev package. Alternatively, if you
only want the command line tools, you can build with HAVE_X11=no.

DOWNLOAD

The latest development source is available directly from the git repository:

	git clone http://mupdf.com/repos/mupdf.git

In the mupdf directory, update the third party libraries:

	git submodule update --init

INSTALLING (UNIX)

Typing "make prefix=/usr/local install" will install the binaries, man-pages,
static libraries and header files on your system.

REPORTING BUGS AND PROBLEMS

The MuPDF developers hang out on IRC in the #ghostscript channel on
irc.freenode.net.

Report bugs on the ghostscript bugzilla, with MuPDF as the selected component.

If you are reporting a problem with PDF parsing, please include the problematic
file as an attachment.
